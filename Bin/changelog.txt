0.0.1
- First version. 
- Very basic IRC code that allows the bot to join a server and idle in a channel

0.0.2
- Implemented the AIML dll and added AIML support
- Added the start of Kon's original brain
- Added multiple console commands

0.0.3
- Added bot commands that can be accessed via users on IRC:
  !splash, !quit, !reload, !togglebrain, !braininfo  

0.0.4
- Added code to generate and read a configuration file (in XML format)
- Added /quit

1.0.5
- Added the first incarnation of "Google Brain"
- Added the filter class
- Seperated the AIML brain from Kon's original brain
- Added !toggleGoogle
- Changed !togglebrain to !toggleAIML

1.0.6
- Changed "brain.kon" to "kon.brain" in order to keep consistency later on (with new brain
  additions).
- Updated AIML dll by myself in order to try and improve memory management.  The new dll MUST be 
  used in order for this version of Kon to work correctly (it is included in the zip and in both 
  src folders).
- Improved and fixed the PING/PONG so that it finally sends the correct information back
- Improved most of the IRC code.  The ReceiveData() method now uses a combination of IF/ELSE 
  and SWITCH statements to determine what the server messages are showing up (for example "PING" 
  or "PRIVMSG", etc).  This was changed from pure IF/ELSE.
- Added multiple methods to handle various messages (QUIT method, PRIVMSG method, etc)
- Added a reconnect() method.  ** It is in testing stages right now and may not work completely
  right.
- Added try/catch to the logger method to try and prevent certain errors
- Changed the way the log file works slightly to try and prevent exceptions and to just improve it
- Added an authorize() method and made it so that submitting the user and nick are now in that
  method
- Fixed an exception that kept being thrown when quitting
- Removed the "full path" stuff from the main function when generating and reading the config file.
  This will hopefully stop a bug that keeps appearing.
- Changed Kon's AI line grabbing method to include a seed based on the computer's time instead of 
  letting the computer do it manually.  
- Changed Kon's AI filter a little bit to not include lines that are less than 5 characters in
  length.
- Added the ability for Kon to address random channel users instead of just the person talking 
  to him.
- Changed the location of the replace emoticon functions from AI.cs to filter.cs.
- Added the very first version of "LB Brain" -- a brain that's based on BishounenNightBird (from
  Esper.net)'s "Language Bot" (LB).  Mine isn't 100% like his, but it's close enough.
- Changed "UNNAMED USER" to "UNNAMED_USER" to resolve conflicting problems in LB Brain.
- Added a /raw console command that sends things directly to the server
- Changed the way it replaces UNNAMED_USER so that if it's UNNAMED_USER: it will address the person
  talking to the bot.  Other UNNAMED_USERs will still be replaced with a random person.

1.0.7
- Fixed an error when you toggle the LB brain off that caused the bot to crash.
- Fixed an error with !LBinfo when the LB brain wasn't loaded.
- Tried to fix the reconnect command, again.
- Seperated the IncomingCommand method into its own file.
- Seperated the ConsoleCommand method into its own file.
- Seperated the logging method into its own file.
- Added !konInfo to the list of commands.  This will send the version information to the channel.
- Changed the way the LB brain works by seperating questions and statements.  Now when someone
  asks a question to the bot, it will reply with a statement (a non-question).  Otherwise, it'll be
  random whether or not it asks a question or replies with a statement.
- Fixed a channel user list bug that wasn't showing the list of channel users after someone talked
  to the bot for the first time.  
- Added a !channelusers  command that will display all the users in the channel (for
  testing purposes) ** warning: don't use this command in an extremely busy channel with a ton 
  of users (more than 30) or else it might crash the bot.
- Added an !utter command that will Kon to randomly say something to the channel.
- Added an admin section to the config file.  <admin>YOURNICKGOESHERE</admin>   Admins 
  have access to all commands and have the ability to add 'users' to the list.
- Commands have been broken down by type: admin only, users, anyone.  
  ADMIN ONLY commands:  !addUser (nick), !remUser (nick),  !quit
  ADMIN AND USERS ONLY commands: !reloadAIML, !toggleAIML, !toggleGoogle, 
                                 !toggleLB, !channelUsers, !utter
  ANYONE commands: !splash, !konInfo, !brainInfo, !LBinfo
- Fixed a bug in previous versions where Kon would spout two responses for one input line.
- Fixed a bug that caused Kon to reply to the main channel when someone messaged him in private.  
  Now he will respond to private messages by messaging the person who is talking to him.

1.0.8
- Fixed an error so that Kon can now respond to null messages addressed to him.
- Fixed the "Google Brain" so that it works again with the new way Google displays results.  
- Started a grammar fixing function that will attempt to fix certain grammar issues (such as 
  "am you" to "are you").  Right now it doesn't fix too much but that will change in later 
  versions.
- Added code for Kon to TRY and locate the topic in what you say directly to him.  It's still in
  testing and may not work very well.  Once a topic will be found, Kon will try to build his
  reply around that topic.  Note: this only works with the LB Brain and really only works well
  if Kon has seen enough text.
- Added a new admin and user command: !toggleTopic which will toggle the "topic search" on/off.
- Wrote a utility for Kon called "LB Brain Utility."  For now it can reorganize the two LB brain
  files so that all the starting sentence lines are at the top.  This will hopefully speed Kon up
  when creating sentences.   ** Note: you must run this utility while Kon is offline.  And you
  may want to make a backup of your brain files before running it.

1.0.9
- Fixed a small bug that prevented Kon from seeing the first word in a sentence if it could 
  potentially be a topic of a sentence.
- Changed the way topics are picked so that it randomly chooses one if there's more than one.
- Changed the way topic sentences are constructed.  Now Kon tries to build the sentence AROUND the
  topic, not START the sentence with the topic.   This may or may not work as intended. 
- Added a little more filter to LB Brain responses to try and not end up with a lone " or misplaced
   at the end of sentences.
- Added the ability to have a longer depth in LB Brains. This should help in larger brain files.
  Note old brain files cannot be converted over though they should still work.
- Added a method to handle the appearance of PART messages.
- Added a method to handle the appearance of NICK changes.
- Added a method to handle the appearance of NOTICE messages.
- Added a method to handle the appearance of MODE messages.
- Changed the way Kon handles the JOIN display so that it can sit in multiple channels and show
  people who join multiple channels (before it would only show the one set in the variable).
- Added "RandomTalk" to Kon.  In the config file add the line <randomTalk>#</randomTalk> where #
  is 1 to 100.  100 means it will randomly talk to every single line it sees, whereas 1 means 1%
  of the time.  As with everything, this works best with LB Brain active, topic searching on and
  a fairly decent-sized brain to work with.
- Added the command !randomTalk [#]   By itself the command will tell the users what % is set;
  users can also set what percent they would like it to be by adding a number from 1 to 100.

1.0.10
- Fixed a small potential bug with !utter
- Changed !randomTalk # so that it reflects a message when the % has been changed.
- Changed randomTalk so that setting it to 0 will really shut it off.
- Changed the /join console command so that more than one channel can be joined.
- Changed all commands to display the text in the channel in which the command was used.
- Added a !join #channel command.  User level.  
- Added a !part #channel command.  User level.   
- Adjusted many commands to work with multiple channels rather than the defined channel.

1.0.11
- Fixed a small issue of certain modes not displaying all of the data (such as opping not showing who was opped).
- Changed the logger and display so that it shows which channel the line appears in. I.e. [#channel] <nick> message
- Fixed an error that would cause the bot to chop off the ":" in an emoticon if that was the first thing said in a line.
- Added a /CLEAR command to the console.  Will clear the window of all text.
- Worked on the reconnect code...again.
- Added a check to stop the bot from reconnecting if it reconnects more than 5 times in a session.
- Added method to handle the appearance of KICK messages.
- Tried to improve how the LB Brain constructs sentences with a topic.
- Fixed another small potential bug with !utter
- Changed the /SAY /PART and /JOIN commands slightly. 
   /SAY #channel message   will send a message to the channel you specify
   /SAY message   will try to send the message to the default channel (the one it joins upon startup)
   /PART #channel  will try to leave the channel you specify
   /PART    will try to leave the default channel (the one it joins upon startup)
   /JOIN #channel  still works the same, just some internal things were changed to help with the changes to the other commands.

1.1.0
- Rewrote some of the main code to better handle reconnecting.
- Added a whole new thread to maintain and check on the connection status of the bot.
- Added a !disconnect command, admin level

1.1.1
- Moved PingControl to its own file.
- Fixed PingControl so that it actually pings the server as intended.
- Added a check that will help check to see if the bot has pinged out and not realized it.  If so, it will attempt 
  to reconnect.
- Added <retryAttempts>#</retryAttempts> to the config file. If you want the bot to attempt to reconnect more than the
  default 5 times, set it in here.
- Added a new user-level command: !Dinfo      Will show a few tidbits of internal info (reconnect attempt/total, if 
  ping control is set to true, and the # of ping attempts so far).   Really only useful for myself, but you might 
  find it interesting.
- Changed the reconnect time to three minutes to allow time for ghosts to ping out on the server.

1.2.0
- Added the ability for Kon to send messages to Twitter.  Right now this uses the LB Brain to construct a random
  sentence and send it up to a twitter account.  You will need to add the following to your config file if you want
  to use this feature:
    <useTwitter>true</useTwitter>
    <twitterUserName>your twitter user name goes here</twitterUserName>
    <twitterPassword>your twitter password goes here</twitterPassword>
  It should send a new message initially upon connecting to the IRC server and again around every hour/hour and a half
  afterwards
- Added a new console command.   /TwitterInfo    Will display information about the built-in twitter client.  This
  may be expanded in the future.
- Added a new USER-LEVEL command: !twitter    The command will return the current twitter status (if twitter client
  is on and in use).  

1.2.1
- Fixed a minor problem with the Twitter client.
- Made it so if the Twitter Client fails, it will write the error into KonLog.txt
- Made it so Kon can use the newer version of Twitterizer, which in-turn should allow Kon to post on Twitter again after
  the DOS attack they had recently.

1.3.0
- Kon should try to pick a random name when posting to twitter instead of posting "UNNAMED_USER" all the time.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Kon from seeing every person sitting in a channel
- Changed the way Kon replaces UNNAMED_USER so that it can use more than one person's name (randomly).
- Changed the way Kon handles ACTIONs in twitter to replace the "ACTION" with a "*"
- Removed Google Brain.  Google has changed the way their searches work and Google Brain is no longer functioning.
- Removed the !toggleGoogle command due to the removal of Google Brain.
- Added a way for Kon to attempt to string two sentences together if the first sentence is too short. Requires LB Brain.
- Added a new command: !toggleDoubleSentences  it's a user-level command and will toggle the two sentences attempt on/off.
- Kon will now attempt to use a simple form of punctuation in replies.  It may not always be correct, however.
- Tried to improve the "TOPIC SEARCH" function of the LB Brain, to better pull out a topic from a sentence.
- Improved the Word search function in the LB Brain so that word case shouldn't matter any more when addressing the bot.
- Updated the LB Brain Utility to version 1.1.0.  Now contains an option to read a txt file and convert it into Kon's brain.

1.4.0
- Added the ability for Kon to filter out repeat sentence starters but keep the rest of the sentence when adding new lines.
- Updated the LB Brain Utility to also filter out repeat sentence starters.
- Improved the "KON" to "UNNAMED_USER" filtering.  Hopefully now it won't replace the word "kon" if it appears in the 
  middle of another word.
- Improved the word search function of the LB Brain again.
- Continued to improve/work on the reconnect code. Specifically, the error 451 that prevents the bot from reconnecting.
  It might actually be completely fixed this time around.
- Added a new console command: /TOGGLEPONG   It will toggle the display of the ping/pong messages. Useful for debugging
  in some cases.
- Changed the way the reconnect attempts work so that it sets it to 0 when the bot actually connects to the server ala
  most IRC clients. 

1.4.1
- Added better filtering of URLs.
- Updated the LB Brain Utility to fix an error that was discovered after the last version release.
- Improved Kon's ability to combine sentences together so that it will hopefully not repeat the same line twice.
- Improved the grammer filter slightly.
- Added the ability for Kon to respond to CTCP PING requests done by users.
- Added the ability for Kon to respond to CTCP VERSION requests.
 
1.4.2
- Fixed a very minor mistake in which the LB Brain wasn't actually searching the entire sentence for the key word like it
  was supposed to.
- Kon can not attempt to use two key words in a conversation to try to create a "topic" to use to create his response.

1.4.3
- Changed the way Kon handles "(" and ")" in sentences.  If a "(" is found but no ")" then it will add the closing ")" but
  if a ")" is found but no "(" is found, then it will remove the ")" -- This should help clean up sentences a bit.
- Kon is now using Twitterizer version 2.3.0.  The old dll is no longer needed.  Twitterizer2.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.dll are.
- Fixed the Twitter aspect to work with the new Oauth system.  It's a bit complicated should you want to hook Kon up to your
  own account to post now.  I'll explain in the readme.txt.  Please read it if you're interested.
- Updated Kon so that it must now have .net Framework version 3.5 installed to run.
- Set a final effort to replace UNNAMED_USER in tweets if the original method does not catch it.
- Updated the LB Brain again.  I'm not really sure if this upgrade will make it better or worse.  
  Some replies might be slower as it constructs its sentences (especially if your brain file is bigger).  However, it
  now tries to go backwards as well as forwards when constructing sentences to help better construct full sentences.

1.5.0
- Changed the way the LB Brain is once again.  Questions and statements are no longer separated.  This means you'll have
  to start over with your brain files as the old ones will no longer work.  
- Added "Answer Search"
- Added <ident>IRC ident here</ident> to the config file.  Use it to control the ident of the bot.
- Added <realname>user'sRealNameHere</realName> to the config file.  Use it to control the real name of the bot.

1.5.1
- Added a /MSG console command.  Use it like so: /MSG person message
- Fixed the ident and RealName upon connecting the bot.  They should be in the right spot now.
- Fixed the RealName so that it doesn't show the server any more in it.

1.5.2
- Added another way to address the bot.  Now if you just use the bot's name at the start of a sentence it will 
  act the same way as if you were using bot:  
- Added an auto-perform command.  Here's how it works.  Open perform.kon in your favorite plain text editor (notepad
  will do fine).  The commands recognized are: JOIN, MSG, SAY, RAW and WAIT.  Use one command on one line each. Examples:
   JOIN #channel 
   SAY #channel yo dawg!
   MSG Nickserv identify password
   WAIT   <--  this command causes the bot to pause inbetween commands for a few seconds.  Use this if you have a lot
               so that you don't cause the bot to flood and be disconnected.
   RAW    <--  Can use this to send raw IRC commands to the server to cover anything else you may want to do.
  * If you use MYBOTNAME (in all caps like that) it will replace it with the bot's current nick on the server.
  If you're still confused, I've included a sample perform file as perform.kon.example.  
- Added the ability for the bot to recognize multiple admins in the config file.  
- Added a new ADMIN LEVEL command: !Msg   Use it like  !msg #chan/person message
- Added a new ADMIN level command: !Raw   Use it like  !raw RAW IRC COMMAND USAGE HERE
- Updated the filter a little bit.
- Updated the LB Brain Utility to version 1.2.1.
- Fixed a bug with the !randomTalk command.
- Fixed a bug in which Random Talk was not working correctly.

1.5.3
- Added the USER LEVEL command: !haiku  This command will cause the bot to attempt to create a haiku using the 
  5/7/5 syllable structure. It's not perfect and the counts will often be a little off but it's a start. Needs the 
  LB Brain to be on in order to work properly.
- Changed the "Answer Search" code slightly so that it tries to find more than one answer to the same line.  This may or may not
  help/improve anything.
- Fixed the Twitter aspect so that it works with the 1.1 OATH system.
